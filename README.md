# Trying to resolving coding issues
I am now trying to pull to VS Code.

made some changes here to check whether any coding issues occur.

I am trying to be one of the best web developers out there. 

Infact, I want to be a full stack web developer with excellent knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS, PHP(+FRAMEWORKS) and PYTHON(+FRAMEWORKS).
